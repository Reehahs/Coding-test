# Coding-test
This is for KnockNow's coding test's solution

Run this in any python environment, the input will need to be given manually and, you can copy paste the input in when it requests it.
The input has to be formatted like L4, Address, Date 
Any other formatting of the input will break the code as I was not instructed to worry about that specifically in the question. 
Thanks, Shaheer
